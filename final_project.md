# Final Project
This project can take many forms:  website, game, research project. It can be exploratory in nature, meaning it does not need a thesis.

Sample projects:

* https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html

Some datasets: https://www.apa.org/research/responsible/data-links

Students must get approval of their proposal before starting on the project. 

# Proposal
The goal of this this assignment is to identify the objectives of your final project and the constraints that might keep your from achieving that goal. The proposal format is modeled on the Project Lab. It's okay if you can't answer all these questions, that's why this proposal is in discussion board format. Please provide feedback and suggestions on your classmate's proposals. 

## Abstract
Summary of project: (1 short paragraph)

## Need
Identify the audience for this project, and the conditions that make the project necessary and beneficial for your key audiences (1-2 paragraphs).

## Impact and Intended Results
A brief explanation that combines your environmental scan and your research goals. Why is what you are doing necessary and different in your field? (1-2 paragraphs)

## Plan
Rough outline and project calendar that includes project design and evaluation, and possibly a communications plan,  with major deliverables (bullet-pointed list of phases and duration). Identify what objectives are met in each phase of the project and what constraints may hinder the work. Also include descriptions of and links to any datasets you plan to use in the project. Use the project check in dates on the syllabus as milestones.

## Project Resources: Personnel and Management
If a team project, description of what each team member will do on the project. (only required if team, 1 paragraph/list)

## Sustainability
If applicable, describe how this project will live beyond the class. Will it continue to be accessible? How so? Is there a desire to turn this into a senior thesis? (optional, 1 paragraph)

## Update 1

Submit an update that includes:
1. Summary of completed milestones, including contribution of each team member
2. Snapshots/demos/preliminary versions of completed deliverables
3. Discussion of missed milestones and explaination of roadblocks that are hindering progress
4. Plan for meeting missed and outstanding milestones/delverables
5. If necessary, revision of goals/objectives/scope of the project. 

## Update 2
Submit an update that includes:
1. Summary of completed milestones, including contribution of each team member
2. Snapshots/demos/preliminary versions of completed deliverables
3. Discussion of missed milestones and explaination of roadblocks that are hindering progress
4. Plan for meeting missed and outstanding milestones/delverables
5. If necessary, revision of goals/objectives/scope of the project. 
6. Very rough draft of final wrap up and presentation

## Final Project and Presentation

The final submission will be a report/github page and an oral presentation that presents the project in scientific form, meaning that it will roughly have the following information:

1. Introduction/Background/Audience:
    * What is the project? 
    * Who is it for? 
    * Why is it being undertaken?
2. Materials & Methods:
    * How was the project implemented? 
    * What data/libraries/tools/analysis techniques were used? 
    * Why were they chosen?  
3. Results & Discussions
    * Were the objectives met? How?
    * What were the findings of the project?
    * What worked?
    * What went wrong?
4. Conclusions:
    * What was learned?
    * Did the project generate new questions? ideas? 
    * Is there a next step?
